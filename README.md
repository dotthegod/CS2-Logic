# Logic Entites
There is bunch of logic entites out there but we will use few of them:

-`logic_auto`

-`logic_case`

-`logic_compare`

-`logic_relay`

-`logic_eventlistener`

## logic_auto

logic_auto is a logic entity that does its job auto. We most of the time use it with the `OnMapSpawn` output with `point_servercommand` entity to set console commands for our maps (you can also add it to your maps cfg). `OnMapSpawn` output fires once every round. So you can use it however you need.

## logic_case

logic_case is a logic entity that you can use to trigger various outputs from it.

It has a randomizing feature which we can use to get random outputs.

I will be telling more about logic_case later on the document.

## logic_compare

logic_compare is a logic entity that lets you compare values. It can be useful with point systems.

I will be telling more about logic_compare later on the document.
