CS2 Entity logic document to people understand

# Logic Entites
There is bunch of logic entites out there but we will use few of them:

-`logic_auto`

-`logic_case`

-`logic_compare`

-`logic_relay`

-`logic_eventlistener`

##logic_auto

logic_auto is a logic entity that does itS job auto. We most of the time use it with the `OnMapSpawn` output with `point_servercommand` entity to set console commands for our maps (you can also add it to your maps cfg). `OnMapSpawn` output fires once every round. So you can use it however you need.
